three principles of functionality
1. Delegation Model: The Java Virtual Machine and the Java ClassLoader use an algorithm called the Delegation Hierarchy Algorithm to Load the classes into the Java file. 
The ClassLoader works based on a set of operations given by the delegation model. They are:
ClassLoader always follows the Delegation Hierarchy Principle.
Whenever JVM comes across a class, it checks whether that class is already loaded or not.
If the Class is already loaded in the method area then the JVM proceeds with execution.
If the class is not present in the method area then the JVM asks the Java ClassLoader Sub-System to load that particular class, then ClassLoader sub-system hands over the control to Application ClassLoader.
Application ClassLoader then delegates the request to Extension ClassLoader and the Extension ClassLoader in turn delegates the request to Bootstrap ClassLoader.
